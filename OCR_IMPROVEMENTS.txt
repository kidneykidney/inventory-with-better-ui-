✨ WHAT'S NEW:
==============

Your OCR system now includes smart data cleaning that will automatically:

👤 STUDENT NAMES:
   • "sarahhhhh" → "Sarah" (removes excessive repeated letters)

   • "SARAH   JOHNSON" → "Sarah Johnson" (fixes spacing)
   • Removes numbers and special characters from names

🆔 STUDENT IDs:
   • "STUD 2025 001" → "STUD2025001" (removes spaces)
   • "STUD-2025-001" → "STUD2025001" (removes dashes)
   • Keeps only valid alphanumeric characters

📧 EMAIL VALIDATION:
   • Only accepts properly formatted emails
   • Rejects invalid formats automatically
   • "sarah.johnson@university.edu" → ✅ Accepted
   • "invalid-email" → ❌ Rejected

🏫 DEPARTMENT NAMES:
   • "computer science" → "Computer Science"
   • Handles combined departments with "&"
   • Proper capitalization and spacing

🚀 TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS:
===========================

1. Stop your current system:
   • Close backend and frontend windows
   OR
   • Run: stop-system.bat

2. Restart with your preferred method:
   • start-system.bat (Quick Python start)
   • start-docker.bat (Docker containers)  
   • start-dev.bat (Development mode)

3. Try uploading the same invoice image again
   • You should now see "Sarah" instead of "sarahhhhh"
   • All data will be properly cleaned and formatted

💡 The system will now provide better data quality with automatic cleaning!
