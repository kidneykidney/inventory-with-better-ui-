# Inventory Management System

This is a collaborative inventory management project developed by our team of three developers using React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Team Branches
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `dev-person1` - Development branch for team member 1
- `dev-person2` - Development branch for team member 2
- `dev-person3` - Development branch for team member 3

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Switch to your assigned branch
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start developing your features
5. Create pull requests to merge changes back to main

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Each team member works on their own branch
- Regular commits with descriptive messages
- Create pull requests for code reviews before merging
- Keep branches updated with main branch changes

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React TypeScript template for fast development and optimal build performance.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode using Vite.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits with lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches Vitest test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Preview the production build locally using Vite's preview server.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

Note: Vite uses `VITE_` prefix for environment variables instead of `REACT_APP_`.
