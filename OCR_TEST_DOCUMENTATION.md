### 3. Validation Checklist

When testing, verify that:

- [ ] All student information is correctly extracted
- [ ] Staff names with titles (Dr., Prof., etc.) are recognized
- [ ] Invoice numbers and dates are parsed correctly
- [ ] All equipment items are extracted with quantities and prices
- [ ] Financial totals are calculated correctly
- [ ] Additional fields like notes and emergency contacts are captured
- [ ] The extracted data appears correctly in the bulk upload review screen
- [ ] You can edit any incorrectly extracted information
- [ ] The final invoice creation includes all the extracted data

### 4. Troubleshooting

If OCR doesn't extract fields correctly:

1. **Check image quality** - Ensure text is clear and readable
2. **Verify text format** - OCR works best with standard fonts and clear contrast
3. **Check field patterns** - The system looks for specific patterns (e.g., "Student ID:", "Name:", etc.)
4. **Test different invoices** - Try the simple format if the comprehensive one has issues

### 5. Performance Notes

- The comprehensive invoice contains the most data and tests all extraction capabilities
- Processing time may vary based on image size and system performance
- All test images are created at 300 DPI for optimal OCR accuracy
- The system should handle all three invoice formats successfully

## ðŸ”§ Development Notes

These test invoices are designed to validate the enhanced bulk OCR functionality that extracts:

1. **Complete student profiles** with all contact information
2. **Full staff details** including titles and designations  
3. **Comprehensive equipment lists** with pricing and condition data
4. **Financial calculations** including deposits and fees
5. **Project metadata** like purpose, location, and supervision
6. **Additional context** such as emergency contacts and special instructions

The images use realistic data and professional formatting to ensure the OCR system can handle real-world invoice scenarios.
